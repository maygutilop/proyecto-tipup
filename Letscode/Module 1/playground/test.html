 <h1> Chess Game</h1>
 <center><h2>The king (♔,♚)</h2></center>
    <div><center><img src="/Module 1/my-project/images/unnamed.png" alt="width="200" height="200" /></center></div>
<p>
 A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or
 diagonally) unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece or
 the move would place the king in check.
 </p>
 <center><h2>The queen (♕, ♛)</h2></center>
 <div><center><img src="/Module 1/my-project/images/reina.png" alt="width="200" height="200" /></center></div>
 <p>
 The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line
 vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the
 rook and bishop.
 </p>
 <center><h2>The bishop (♗,♝</h2></center>
 <div><center><img src="/Module 1/my-project/images/alfil.png" alt="width="200" height="200" /></center></div>
 <p>
 The bishops may be differentiated according to which wing they begin on,
 i.e. the king's bishop and queen's bishop. As a consequence of its
 diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on either the white or black
 squares, and so it is also common to refer to them as light-squared or
 dark-squared bishops.
 </p>
 <center><h2>The knight (♘,♞)</h2></center>
 <div><center><img src="/Module 1/my-project/images/caballo-ajedrez-para-colorear.jpg" alt="width="200" height="200" /></center></div>
 <p>
 The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. It moves to a square that
 is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares
 vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move therefore looks
 like the letter "L". Unlike all other standard chess pieces, the knight
 can "jump over" all other pieces (of either color) to its destination
 square.
 </p>
 <center><h2>The rook (♖,♜)</h2></center>
 <div><center><img src="/Module 1/my-project/images/torre.jpg" alt="width="200" height="200" /></center></div>
 <p>
 The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of
 unoccupied squares (see diagram).
 </p>
 <center><h2>The pawn (♙,♟)</h2></center>
 <div><center><img src="/Module 1/my-project/images/peon.png" alt="width="200" height="200" /></center></div>
 <p>
 Unlike the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Normally a pawn
 moves by advancing a single square, but the first time a pawn moves, it
 has the option of advancing two squares.
